1. Install SASS
Go to https://sass-lang.com/install and run this code in your terminal: <code>npm install -g sass</code>. You'll need to install Node.js if you don't have it already.
2. Let SASS watch for any changes and compile the CSS
In the terminal, go to the <code>/css</code> folder and type <code>sass --watch /sass:/public</code>
